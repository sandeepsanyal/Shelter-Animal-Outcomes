# Animal Shelter Outcome Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcome type of pets in an animal shelter based on various features such as animal type, age, breed, and color. The outcome type is a categorical variable with five levels.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd animal_shelter_outcome_prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To perform exploratory data analysis, open the `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
- Use the `src/data_processing.py` module to load and preprocess the datasets.
- Implement feature engineering in `src/feature_engineering.py`.
- Train machine learning models using `src/model_training.py`.
- Make predictions on new datasets with `src/model_prediction.py`.
